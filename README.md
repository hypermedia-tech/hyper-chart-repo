## Hypermedia Au Base Helm Charts

These charts are designed to drive argocd applicationSet and AppOfApp's deployments.

WARNING: some of the charts are used in production and production like environments and could change at any time.

There are other affordances wrapping these charts later in the CD processes, so ensure you consider your full strategy.

These are a good starting point for an exploration of umbrella chart ApplicationSet driven infrastructure and user space environment management.

Create your gitops backplane first and experiment with it to understand how these solutions look to the engineering teams who will support them.
